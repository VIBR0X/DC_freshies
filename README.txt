Basic Web Development

Hello everyone

Welcome to this session on Web Development by DevCom and WnCC. This session will guide you through the basics of Web Development including, but not limited to Git, HTML, CSS.

The course has no prerequisites (except for knowing how to type and use a browser)

The first thing that you need to learn is how to create your webpage and put content into it. HTML is what does that job for you.

Although the common text editors serve the basic purpose, it is often recommended to use advanced editors that make it easier for you to
code seamlessly. The choice of code editors is entirely based on one's own preferences with each editor offering its own advantages. 
We'll be using VS Code.

Few important emmets in VS Code

 ! : You can create HTML file and write your first letter '!' and press enter. You will have a HTML boiler plate ready for use.

 lorem : Dummy text is very much important in Web designing, for checking how your text will look with formatting. Lorem serves us with exactly
 the same. Just write lorem and press enter and you will get some dummy words. Also if you want like 34 words, you just need to type lorem34
 and it will give 34 dummy words!

Live Server Once you activate live server. You need not to reload your website. Just go live and everytime you save your changes in VS Code, it gets automatically updated in your web browser.
